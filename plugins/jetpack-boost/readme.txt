Speed up your website by optimizing page performance with Jetpack Boost!

== Description ==

Jetpack Boost provides one-click optimizations that supercharge your WordPress siteâ€™s performance and improve web vitals
 scores for better SEO.

### Performance Modules

Optimize your site with the same techniques used on the world's most successful websites. Each technique is packaged up as a module that you can activate and try out.

Currently the plugin has 3 performance modules available:

1. *Optimize CSS Loading* generates Critical CSS for your homepage, posts and pages. This can allow your content to show up on the screen much faster, particularly for viewers using mobile devices.

   Read more about critical CSS generation at [web.dev](https://web.dev/extract-critical-css/)

1. *Defer Non-Essential Javascript* moves some tasks to after the page loads, so that important visual information can be seen sooner.

1. *Lazy Image Loading* only loads the images the user can see. As the user scrolls, images are loaded just before they show up on the page. This simple optimization makes sites faster and saves bandwidth for your host and your customers.

### Easy Setup

There's nothing to configure - the setup process is as easy as:

 1. Install the plugin
 2. Activate Jetpack Connection
 3. Turn on performance modules one by one and observe how the performance score changes

 Google PageSpeed API is used to measure the performance score of a site. It's important to look at the PageSpeed score because Core Web Vitals are going to be used as a ranking factor in search engines.

### With ðŸ’š by Jetpack

This is just the start!

We are working hard to bring more features and improvements to Jetpack Boost. Let us know your thoughts and ideas!

We'd also like to give a special THANK YOU to the XWP team who provided help with initial research and scoping of the plugin and were engaged with our team throughout the project.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==


= What are Web Vitals? =

Web Vitals are the measurements that Google uses to better understand the user experience on a website. By improving Web Vitals scores you're also improving the user experience on your site.

You can read more about Web Vitals on [web.dev](https://web.dev/vitals/)


= How do I know if it's working? =

Every site is different and so performance benefits for each module may vary from site to site. That's why we recommend that you measure the performance improvements on your site by enabling the performance modules one by one. There are many tools out there that you can use for free to measure performance improvements:

* [WebPageTest.org](https://www.webpagetest.org/easy)
* [web.dev/measure](https://web.dev/measure/)
* [PageSpeed Insights](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/)
* [GTMetrix](https://gtmetrix.com/)

Google PageSpeed measurements are built-in the Jetpack Boost dashboard.

= Does it work with static page cache? =
Absolutely! If you have plugins like WP Super Cache or W3 Total Cache installed - Jetpack Boost is only going to help increase the performance benefits! Keep in mind that you need to wait for the cache to clear for Jetpack Boost improvements to show up.

= Does this plugin require Jetpack? =

Jetpack Boost is a part of the Jetpack brand, but it doesnâ€™t require Jetpack plugin to run. This is a separate plugin from Jetpack and it will always remain that way.


== Installation ==

1. Install Jetpack Boost via the plugin directory, and activate it.
2. Visit the "Jetpack Boost" section of your site's WP Admin.
3. Turn on the performance features you would like to try out on your site.
